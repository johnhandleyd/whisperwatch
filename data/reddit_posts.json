with this conspiracy for years—are now backpedaling and trying to rationalize why the most obvious conclusion is the least conspicuous—especially in the minds of fox news viewers:\\nfox news deliberately edited out a portion of trump\\'s response during an interview when he was asked if he would release the \"epstein client list.\"\\ntrump\\'s initial response was:\\n> \"yeah, i think we should release it. people deserve to know.\"\\nfox news edited out his follow up:\\n> \"but you have to understand, there’s a lot of lies in that list. a lot of names that shouldn’t be there. you don’t want to ruin innocent lives.\"\\neven outside of this whole epstein controversy, trump has been accused of sexual abuse, harassment or rape by dozens of women dating back to the 70s.\\ntrump\\'s depravity knows no bounds and his supporters have always overlooked his history of sexual misconduct—particularly towards women on the \"younger side.\"\\na book published in 2019 titled all the president\\'s women spoke of at least 43 allegations—one of them from trump\\'s first wife, ivana, who describes in a deposition how trump raped her in a fit of rage.\\nthis wikipedia page goes into greater detail about these incidents.\\nmany of these women have described trump forcibly groping them, grabbing them inappropriately and kissing them without consent.\\nformer miss teen usa contestants claimed that trump would unexpectedly walk into their dressing rooms. one of the girls alleges that she remembers trump saying, “don’t worry ladies, i’ve seen it all before.” the youngest girl was 15 at the time.\\n> in an april 2005 interview on the howard stern show, when asked about miss usa and miss universe, trump said he would go backstage before beauty pageant shows, the only man in the room while the women were “standing there with no clothes.” as the owner, “i sort of get away with things like that,” he added. > samantha holvey, a former miss usa contestant, told cnn in 2016 that when she competed in 2006, trump personally inspected each contestant, looking at them from head to toe like “sexual objects,” which made her feel “the dirtiest i felt in my entire life.” other incidents include, but are not limited to:\\n> jessica leeds, who told the new york times in 2016 that, in the late 1970s, trump, who was a stranger to her, reached his hand up her skirt and grabbed her breasts on a flight to new york. she said he “was like an octopus” and his “hands were everywhere” before she fled to the back of the plane. one woman who worked with trump in the 90s claimed that trump tried to rape her in his daughters bedroom at mar-a-lago.\\nanother woman said she attended a dinner with trump in the 90s where \"several women were forced to walk across a table while trump looked up their skirts and commented on their underwear and bodies.\"\\nthis list goes on and on of women all describing similar encounters with trump.\\nreporter natasha stoynoff describes an incident when she was alone with trump where he \"closed the door and pushed her against the wall before \\'forcing his tongue down her throat.\\'\" this was while she was interviewing trump for a story about his marriage to melania...\\nseveral women also describe trump confronting them with offers to pay them for sex.\\nof course there\\'s always controversies like the stormy daniels case and the \"hollywood access tape.\" it\\'s appalling that these scandals didn\\'t immediately end his political career. in fact, in a desperate move after the hot mic incident, trump staged a surprise press conference where he paraded four women around in front of reporters, each of them alleging that bill clinton abused them. trump had the audacity to \"praise their courage.\" that same year, multiple women came forward speaking out against trump\\'s history of sexual misconduct. in response, trump called them \"horrible, horrible liars.\"\\nas most know, trump was found liable in civil court for sexually assaulting e. jean carroll.\\njudge kaplan clarified recently that the jury\\'s findings in the case align with the common understanding of rape. meaning that—as most people understand it—trump was found by a jury to have raped e jean carroll.\\nthen there\\'s the case involving the plaintiff \"katie johnson\", which was filed in april, 2016 in federal court in california, but then was dismissed a month later.\\nanother incarnation of the case was filed in june of that same year, but was dismissed months later. the case was then again filed by \"jane doe\" in september 2016, but was also eventually dropped.\\nthe accuser was expected to appear at a news conference later that year, but her attorney claimed that she had been receiving death threats and was too afraid to attend.\\nthe case alleges that both donald trump and jeffrey epstein made the plaintiff into a \"sex slave\" at the age of 13 and forced her to perform sexual and depraved acts.\\ntrump and epstein had a friendly, social relationship starting in the late 80s/early 90s. they were both prominent figures in palm beach, florida, where they were often seen together at social events and parties. photos and videos even show the two together at mar-a-lago, laughing and ogling at women.\\nin an interview with new york magazine in 2002, trump said of epstein:\\n> “i’ve known jeff for 15 years. terrific guy. he’s a lot of fun to be with. it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do, and many of them are on the younger side.”\\nin 2005, the police searched epstein\\'s palm beach mansion and found message books that contained the names and numbers of high profile people, including trump.\\nvirginia giuffre, one of epstein\\'s most vocal accusers, claimed

    "top_comments": "[\"some of the main points below:\\n>no one on the supreme court has gone further to enable donald trump’s extreme exercise of presidential power than the chief justice of the united states, john roberts. associate justices have also written some important opinions shaping executive power, and the court has issued ever more important unsigned orders, but the most transformative opinions—the opinions that directly legitimize trump’s unprecedented uses of power—are roberts’s handiwork. this is not happenstance. under supreme court practice, the most senior justice in the majority—which is always the chief justice when he so votes—determines who will write the main opinion. roberts reserved these milestones for himself.\\n>\\n>and what milestones they have been. roberts upheld the first trump administration’s “muslim ban” on the grounds that the president’s national-security role precludes courts from taking account of the bigotry undergirding an immigration order. he remanded a lower court’s enforcement of a congressional subpoena for trump’s financial information, writing that “without limits on its subpoena powers,” congress could exert “imperious” control over the executive branch and “aggrandize itself at the president’s expense.” he has come close to giving the president an untrammeled right to fire any officer in the executive branch at will. and he took the lead in inventing a presidential immunity from criminal prosecution that could exempt the president from accountability for even the most corrupt exercises of his official functions.\\n>\\n>...\\n>\\n>what america is witnessing is a remaking of the american presidency into something closer to a dictatorship. trump is enacting this change and taking advantage of its possibilities, but he is not the inventor of its claim to constitutional legitimacy. that project is the work of john roberts.\\n>\\n>...\\n>\\n>in roberts’s story, the president “alone composes a branch of government” and holds the “entirety” of executive power. all of the federal civil service—the thousands of administrative officers who wield executive power—do so on the president’s behalf. what gives this system “legitimacy and accountability” is that “we, the people” get to vote for president. the thousands of subordinate officers involved in administering the federal government are accountable to “we, the people” only because they are tied to the president through “a clear and effective chain of command.” the point of absolute-removal power is precisely to enable the president to keep his underlings in line. the powers of removal and supervision, roberts writes, are “conclusive and preclusive.” that is to say, at least in roberts’s narrative, congress may not regulate the president’s supervisory powers by statute, and courts may not examine their exercise.\\n>\\n>the alternative to this narrative—the understanding of the constitutional presidency that, at least in broad strokes, had represented conventional wisdom until the advent of the roberts court—is an account of executive power woven into a system of checks and balances. article ii vests executive power in a president, to be sure. it assigns the president a number of exclusive roles, such as the negotiation of treaties and serving as commander in chief of the army and navy. but article ii also envisions a branch that includes “executive departments.” these departments have “duties,” most of which are to be set forth in statutes. fulfilling statutory duties is the job of the agencies, which, in doing their work, act not on behalf of the president, but on behalf of congress. the president’s role in this scheme is one of supervision, not command. he is charged to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” the constitution underscores the president’s supervisory position by providing that he may “require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices.” this is not at all a one-person branch of government, and its design is not the prerogative of the president, but of congress.\\n>\\n>...\\n>\\n>roberts has not approached his work timidly. in the two decades of his tenure thus far, his opinions on executive power have created what might be called a proto-authoritarian canon, lending constitutional legitimacy to a kind of presidency that brooks no dissent, treats congress as a subordinate institution, and need answer to no one except possibly to the supreme court itself.\\n>\\n>it is hard to overstate how much is wrong in roberts’s narrative of the presidency. it muddles constitutional text. it flouts constitutional history. it is willfully ignorant of the risks of authoritarianism in a polarized, populist age. its very premise—that the constitution creates a one-person branch of government—is provably untrue by just reading the constitution, which, again, refers to “executive departments.” the president’s constitutional role does not require at-will removal power, except in the cases of those few officials who directly assist the president in fulfilling specific article ii roles. for all others—the overwhelming majority of government officers and employees—the president needs only the power to discharge persons who have failed to faithfully execute the law, thus providing “good cause” for their removal. the conditions under which the president may fire such officials is a matter for congress to decide.\\n>\\n>the idea that vesting the president with “the executive power” means “all” of the executive power is likewise not in the article ii text, which does not contain the word all. where the word all does appear is in the constitution’s vesting in congress the power to “make all laws which shall be necessary and proper” for executing its role and all others in the government. far from signaling a wide swath of “conclusive and preclusive” executive authority, the text suggests a sweeping legislative power to prescribe how executive power is to be exercised.\\n>\\n>the roberts court narrative fares no better on history than on text. the court claims to be originalist and to be implementing a vision of the presidency that matches that of the framers. the best that can be said about its opinions in this respect is that they have launched a scholarly renaissance among constitutional historians whose work demonstrates that the court has the history wrong. one characteristic of several of the court’s most executive-indulgent opinions is the inclusion of blazingly incorrect statements of history.\\n>\\n>...\\n>\\n>the nation is now just six months into the experiment of what happens when a knows-no-bounds president takes office under a court committed to a unitary executive. the results are alarming. as a matter of principle, anyone concerned with preserving robust constitutional checks and balances should be disturbed by a president’s overweening unilateralism, regardless of that president’s policy agenda. in trump’s case, however, the threat to democracy is at its zenith because unitary-executive theory is being pushed to enable an authoritarian agenda on every front. trump seems to believe he is effectively the unitary head not just of government, but of the nation. he appears determined to squelch any resistance within the government—and to force submission to his program by the media, universities, the legal profession, and apparently even entire cities. roberts’s assurance that elections render the unitary president “directly accountable to the people” for so blatant an antidemocratic program appears meaningless against the backdrop of trump’s authoritarian tactics.\\nit's pretty clear from his words and his deeds that roberts and his enablers believe that the nation requires a monarch rather than a president, and have been working to make that a reality. this, in effect, is what an activist judiciary actually looks like rather than what's been described by conservative commentators in years past.\\nthat one of the other bodies that could help to balance out this extremist view of governance, congress, is unable to come together to oppose this seismic shift points out major faults in the vaunted system of checks and balances, and shows that it is little more than just wishful thinking.\", 'yup, there are many, many gop politicians and lifelong gov employees who have advocated for a strong executive branch since before i was born... and i\\'m not young. there are plenty of people, like a bill barr who is way more open about this in leaked videos from closed dinners, as an example. in many ways 9/11 accelerated this ten fold and we are witnessing a glimpse into what a strong executive branch can look like in america, in an ever increasing right-wing world with like 20 or so national leaders who can unilaterally throw a wrench in democracies and global partnerships around the world. the eu for example, is constantly held by orban giving cover to his benefactors that keep him in power. or they are outright controlling millions of people with iron fist with bureaucrats being tossed out of windows daily, like in putin\\'s russia. as america has slid towards this direction over the past 40+ years with more and more anti-democratic policies and haphazard regional world building ventures based on congress giving up its powers to the executive, it gives cover and reason for other countries to do the same. then suddenly we live in a world of \"presidents for life\". aka regional hegemonies and empires. but yes, the gop is absolutely firmly in camp \\'strong executive\\' and worked tirelessly for this enterprise. and will continue to push for this until elections won\\'t matter and the party can stay in power with little or no effort of placating the people. whatever that ends up looking like. gerrymandering with no court inputs. political operatives put in charge of election boards and dictating byzantine voting rules. etc. etc.\\nat the end of the day, the gop sees democracy is a weak form of government or they wouldn\\'t be working so hard to dismantle its rigor and to control the narrative, and lift up trump like a demi-god regardless of his actual aptitude... or appetites. as long as the party can cut tax and deliver to extreme wealth who are their key supporters, trump will always be their useful tool, with a select group of dark money individuals calling the policy shots. what i\\'m actually scared of is a true and capable authoritarian that can put the capitalists in their place and that\\'s probably much, much closer to reality than i thought possible 20 years ago.', \"here's a thought experiment already playing out in real time: if the president flagrantly poisons a legal proceeding in which he is involved falsifying evidence, exposing evidence that the court has declared under seal, intimidating witnesses, bribing judges, etc. yet claims he is merely exercising the duties of his office, then justice is literally denied, with no consequences to trump at all. the fig leaf--that congress can use their power to impeach--is insufficient when one party's members all have a selfish interest in the outcome of impeachment. of course that violates their oaths of office, but that ship sailed, went to moscow in 2018, and came back with the stamp paid. robert's could have allowed the article iii branch of government to retain its checks and balances, but he threw them under the bus, and there is nothing trump won't do to both exercise power to destroy his enemies. after a long list of truly terrible court decisions, each of which contributed to the weaponization of the presidency, united states vs. trump was the decision that will actually blow everything up.\", \"that's unfair to all the other fascists who contributed. sure, he was instrumental in killing off the rule of law and neutering the usa's constitution but it was a team effort.\\nwhat about his predecessors, taking the first steps towards turning the usa into a banana republic by falsifying an election and undermining civic rights? what about the media moghuls putting their money on the line to fill the country with hate? what about the people working tirelessly to build the republican party into a bastion of corruption and authoritarianism? they've been at it for generations, successfully keeping the ship on course even in those periods when fascism was, to put it mildly, somewhat unpopular.\\nand, finally, what about those millions of people driven by hate, selfishness, greed or malice to elect someone who openly declared himself to be a dictator? don't they deserve ~~blame~~ recognition? it's not as if they're going to get anything else out of this.\", \"as a reminder, this subreddit in general, be courteous to others.

another reported epstein victim, went to police twice back in the 90s to complain about epstein\\'s sexual abuse of girls and young women. she brought up trump\\'s name both times, and not just because of his close relationship with epstein, but also because of an alarming encounter she had with trump at epstein\\'s new york office:\\n> she told the authorities that late one night, mr. epstein unexpectedly called her to his offices in a luxury building in manhattan, and she arrived in running shorts.\\n> mr. trump then arrived, wearing a business suit, and started to hover over her.\\n> ms. farmer said she recalled feeling scared as mr. trump stared at her bare legs. then mr. epstein entered the room, and she recalled him saying to mr. trump: “no, no. she’s not here for you.”\\nadd it to the pile of all the evidence—across decades—that implicates trump in an untold number of sex crimes.\\ntrump is desperately trying to sweep this scandal under the rug. he\\'s even suing the wsj for releasing the infamous birthday letter to epstein:\\n> the letter reportedly concludes: \"happy birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.\"\\ntrump\\'s supporters are refusing to acknowledge his involvement and instead are blaming his direct subordinates for the lack of transparency. some are trying to rationalize why the most obvious conclusion is the least likely—fox news viewers especially:\\nfox news deliberately edited out a portion of trump\\'s response during an interview when he was asked if he would release the \"epstein client list.\"\\ntrump\\'s initial response:\\n> \"yeah, i think we should release it. people deserve to know.\"\\nfox left out his follow up:\\n> \"but you have to understand, there’s a lot of lies in that list. a lot of names that shouldn’t be there. you don’t want to ruin innocent lives.\"\\neven outside of this epstein controversy, trump has been accused of sexual abuse, harassment or rape by dozens of women dating back to the 70s—particularly women on the \"younger side.\"\\na book published in 2019 titled \"all the president\\'s women\" speaks of at least 43 allegations—one of them from trump\\'s first wife. these women have described trump forcibly groping them; grabbing them inappropriately and kissing them without consent.\\nformer miss teen usa contestants claimed that trump would unexpectedly walk into their dressing rooms. one of the girls alleges that she remembers trump saying, “don’t worry ladies, i’ve seen it all before.” the youngest girl was 15 at the time.\\n> in an april 2005 interview on the howard stern show, when asked about miss usa and miss universe, trump said he would go backstage before beauty pageant shows, the only man in the room while the women were “standing there with no clothes.” as the owner, “i sort of get away with things like that,” he added. > samantha holvey, a former miss usa contestant, told cnn that when she competed in 2006, trump personally inspected each contestant, looking at them from head to toe like “sexual objects,” which made her feel “the dirtiest i felt in my entire life.” other incidents include:\\n> jessica leeds, who told the new york times in 2016 that, in the late 1970s, trump, who was a stranger to her, reached his hand up her skirt and grabbed her breasts on a flight to new york. she said he “was like an octopus” and his “hands were everywhere.\"\\none woman claimed that trump tried to rape her in his daughters bedroom at mar-a-lago.\\nreporter natasha stoynoff describes an incident when she was alone with trump where he \"closed the door and pushed her against the wall before \\'forcing his tongue down her throat.\\'\" this was while she was interviewing trump for a story about his marriage to melania.\\nof course there\\'s always the stormy daniels case and the \"hollywood access tape,\" scandals that should have immediately ended his political career. in fact, in a desperate move after the hot mic incident, trump staged a surprise press conference where he paraded four women around in front of reporters, each of them alleging that bill clinton abused them. trump had the audacity to \"praise their courage.\" that same year, multiple women came forward speaking out against trump. in response, trump called them \"horrible, horrible liars.\"\\njudge kaplan clarified recently that the jury\\'s findings in the e jean carroll case align with the common understanding of rape. in other words, trump was found by a jury to have raped e jean carroll.\\nthen there\\'s the case involving the plaintiff \"katie johnson\", filed multiple times in 2016—all suspiciously dismissed.\\nthe accuser was set to appear at a news conference later that year, but her attorney claimed that she had been receiving death threats and was too afraid to attend.\\nthe case alleges that both donald trump and jeffrey epstein made the plaintiff into a \"sex slave\" at the age of 13 and forced her to perform sexual and depraved acts.\\ntrump and epstein had a friendly, social relationship starting in the late 80s. they were both prominent figures in palm beach, florida, where they were often seen together at social events and parties. photos and videos show the two together at mar-a-lago, laughing and ogling at women.\\nin an interview with new york magazine in 2002, trump said of epstein:\\n> “i’ve known jeff for 15 years. terrific guy. he’s a lot of fun to be with. it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do, and many of them are on the younger side.”\\nin 2005, the police searched epstein\\'s palm beach mansion and found message books that contained the names and numbers of high profile people, including trump.\\nvirginia guiffre, one of epstein\\'s most vocal accusers, claimed that she was recruited into epstein\\'s sex trafficking ring while working at mar-a-lago. giuffre sadly died by suicide back in april.\\nit wasn\\'t until epstein\\'s arrest and death in 2019 that trump publicly stated that he wasn\\'t \"a fan\" of epstein.\\nafter ghislaine maxwell\\'s arrest in 2020, trump appeared to show sympathy for her at a press briefing:\\n> “i just wish her well, frankly. i’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since i lived in palm beach, and i guess they lived in palm beach. but i wish her well, whatever it is.\"\\naccording to flight logs released as evidence during maxwell\\'s trial, trump has flown on the \"lolita express\" at least seven times. then there\\'s michael wolff, a journalist who has interviewed trump and had insider access to him and the white house.\\nwolff claims that trump once considered a pardon for maxwell because he was concerned that maxwell might \"spill secrets.\"\\nwolff obtained audio recordings in 2017 of epstein claiming that trump and melania\\'s first sexual encounter took place aboard his private jet.\\non his podcast, fire and fury, wolff stated that epstein once showed him several photographs of trump at epstein’s palm beach mansion, sitting around the pool with topless young girls, some of whom were reportedly sitting in trump\\'s lap.\\nwolff described trump and epstein as \"joined at the hip\" for nearly 15 years. both men have confirmed their close friendship together, they even shared the same women.', 'and ….. maga doesn’t

that seems very cherry picking.\\nthe article gave numbers and explained why it will work for the republicans, the advances in the ability to get it right, exactly how they did it to austin with the same plan. how many districts won by over 60%.\\ni mean, i don't care if strangers don't believe it, but it was a fact filled article and i won't scream fake news because i don't like the work they've done.\", \"i believe that they were cautioned by the rnc not to do this for exactly the reasons i said. i believe that slicing your margins thinner to pick up more seats leaves your party vulnerable in a wave election which can be verified both historically and mathematically. i believe that salon regularly posts inflammatory sensationalism for engagement. i haven't read the politico article so i don't really care if they agree with me.\", \"it's not about rules it's about math. when you gerrymander to claim more districts you're narrowing your lead in the districts you already have. they were warned not to do this by the rnc but they think it will work. this is republicans breaking rules set by other republicans. rules that were put in place for the benefit of republicans. democrats aren't afraid that they will break the rules, they're counting on it.\", \"we have, a bunch of times, probably every congressional election. it's why the house seats fluctuate pretty wildly from session to session, and with cuts both ways.\\nfor a whole variety of reasons such as cutting too thin during an opposing wave, people just naturally moving and deepening the lean of certain districts, etc.\\nit's why gerrymandering is a moving target.\"]",

lots of juicy, salacious accusations, but more damaging to public opinion than actual ironclad evidence to secure convictions. 2. trump is 100% undoubtedly \"in the list\". he\\'s on the flight logs. he was friends with epstein for years. we have witness testimony that epstein recruited girls from mar-a-lago, and public accusations from katie johnson that trump and epstein raped her together. trump is also highly susceptible to blackmail we already know he\\'s a horndog, loves young eastern european model types, and doesn\\'t give a fuck about cheating on his wives. plus he\\'s dumb and easily manipulated, and he ran in the exact sort of circles that epstein did ny high society socialite types. there\\'s simply no way that epstein did what he did for as long as he did, in new york city of all places, without targeting trump. 3. i also think there\\'s a strong possibility that there really is no \"list\". clearly there\\'s some amount of information recovered from raids on epstein\\'s properties - even if it\\'s just more like the flight logs and his phone book that don\\'t directly incriminate anyone but imply association. and there may be some information that\\'s damaging to some people, trump almost undoubtedly included. but it\\'s entirely possible that epstein\\'s treasure trove of blackmail materials was either not found, or was securely encrypted in a way to make it unrecoverable. either pam bondi lied when she said that she had \"the list on her desk\" and \"thousands of videos of abuse victims\", or she lied when she said that there was no list and no evidence of anyone being blackmailed... but i do think that there is some level of possibility that it was the first set of statements that were outright lies, and she\\'s only now having to backtrack because she doesn\\'t actually have anything to release like she claimed. this would also explain why nothing was revealed under the biden admin. that said, the way that trump and his cronies have been acting lately, i\\'m starting to believe less and less that this is the case - and more and more that there is a trove of blackmail material, it\\'s just not clear who on the \"list\" is a real predator and who is a blackmail victim that got roped in unwittingly.', 'i’m so here for a complete divorce from israel.', \"well, he doesn't need his base anymore to get re-elected. but yes, that might be a more plausible explanation than him being in there. he might even be, but would he have campaigned to publicly release them before -

related to its activities in china and mexico, according to the company’s financial filings.\r\nbut that appears to have changed after the trump administration tapped pam bondi — previously an outside legal counsel for pfizer — to lead the justice department as attorney general.\r\nin the company’s most recent annual report filed three weeks after bondi took office in early february, there was no longer any reference to the justice department investigations into the company’s potential violation of the foreign corrupt practice act. a quarterly a report in may also contains no reference to these investigations. on her first day in office, bondi rolled back the enforcement of foreign corruption cases that didn’t involve drug cartels and international criminal organizations, among a host of sweeping changes she made to the department’s priorities. that move was followed five days later, on feb. 10, by a related executive order issued by president donald trump that paused new foreign corruption investigations and enforcement actions.\r\nthe justice department also reportedly reduced the number of attorneys working on such cases and closed nearly half of existing foreign corruption cases.\r\nbondi’s stated goal in making the changes was “removing bureaucratic impediments to aggressive prosecutions,” but the actions she and president trump took were widely seen as a signal that the justice department would be less interested in pursuing allegations that major corporations like pfizer paid bribes to win business abroad.\r\npfizer is among several companies that filed financial documents this year suggesting that the justice department had dropped their federal corruption investigations.\r\nthe consumer advocacy group public citizen raised concerns about bondi’s relationship with pfizer in a letter sent last month to the senate judiciary committee and questions how she may have played a role in the department’s apparent decision to drop the case.\r\n“we would always hope that our elected officials are above reproach ethically and a big part of that is ensuring that they don’t have any conflicts of interest,” said lisa gilbert, the group’s co-president.\r\n“all of this comes back to the appropriateness of pam bondi’s conduct and whether she should be touching anything that approaches pfizer.”\r\nthe justice department told the miami herald that bondi’s work for pfizer had nothing to do with foreign corruption.\r\n“attorney general bondi’s brief work with this company occurred when she was a private citizen, concerned a florida-specific legal matter, and bears no nexus whatsoever to the department of justice’s fcpa guidance. any suggestion to the contrary is incorrect,” said justice department spokesman gates mcgavick.\r\npfizer declined to comment beyond the disclosures in the company’s financial filings. work for fort lauderdale firm\r\nbondi – who previously served as florida’s attorney general for two terms and also was one of trump’s attorneys during his 2019 impeachment trial – represented pfizer while in private practice with the fort lauderdale law firm panza maurer, which she had been affiliated with since 2021, according to her financial disclosure form.\r\nit isn’t clear exactly what bondi did for pfizer but the drug company is the only client she listed in connection with work for the law firm, which paid her more than $200,000 last year. bondi also reported working as a lobbyist for the influential company ballard partners before entering office. the founder of that firm, brian ballard, also is listed as being of counsel with panza maurer, the same title bondi held.\r\nthomas panza, a founding partner of the law firm, declined to say whether the firm is still representing pfizer and on what matters it has represented the pharmaceutical company. he said bondi did work for other clients besides pfizer in the past, but declined to provide names.\r\nhe also said that, to his knowledge, no one from the firm has been in contact with bondi since she took the helm at the justice department.\r\nunder her federal ethics agreement before taking office, bondi promised that she would not participate “personally and substantially” in any matter involving former clients at panza maurer for one year after she last provided service to the client.\r\npfizer isn’t the only former client that has raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest for bondi. the herald earlier reported that bondi, before becoming attorney general, had lobbied on behalf of a china-backed refrigerant company called igas usa which currently has an active lawsuit against the federal government, which is being defended by justice department lawyers.\r\nreading the tea leaves\r\nwhile the justice department doesn’t typically make public when it has decided to drop a foreign corruption investigation without seeking a penalty, legal experts say what a company says – or doesn’t say – in its financial filings can provide clues.\r\n“if they had language about it and then suddenly there’s no language about it, you can probably infer that either the investigation is closed, or they no longer believe that it’s material for investors to know,” said william garrett, who manages a database of foreign corruption cases maintained by stanford university’s law school.\r\npfizer isn’t the only company that appears to have benefited from the new policies.\r\nthree other companies listed in the stanford foreign corruption case database – johnson & johnson, toyota and medical device company stryker – indicated in financial filings this year that the justice department had dropped investigations into potential foreign corruption violations by their companies.\r\nin early april, alina habba, the acting u.s. attorney for new jersey, also dropped charges against executives for cognizant technologies, an information technology consulting and outsourcing company, citing trump’s executive order.\r\npresident’s trump’s pause on new foreign corruption cases was lifted last month, and the department said it would resume bringing new cases but that it would prioritize focusing on the conduct of individuals rather than attributing “nonspecific” wrongdoing to “corporate structures.”\r\nthe recent foreign corruption investigations involving pfizer weren’t the first time the company’s foreign activities came under such scrutiny. in 2012, pfizer subsidiaries agreed to pay the federal government more than $60 million in penalties and surrendered profits and interest in response to allegations of corruption in a number of different countries.\r\n“pfizer took short cuts to boost its business in several eurasian countries, bribing government officials in bulgaria, croatia, kazakhstan and russia to the tune of millions of dollars,” mythili raman, then the principal deputy assistant attorney general at the justice department, said of one of the investigations.\r\nmore recently, pfizer disclosed that the foreign corruption units from the justice department and the sec had requested documents connected to the company’s activities in russia in 2019, but the company ceased making any mention of that investigation last year.",

indeed, we\\'re slowly normalising that so that the line is at 18 we\\'ve changed it recently so you can\\'t get married at 16 anymore, for instance.\\nsecondly, linking it to paying tax is an awful justification. obviously it\\'s harkening back to the \"no taxation without representation\" that the americans espouse, so it\\'s got that going against it. but more importantly is that everyone pays tax - anyone who has bought anything has almost certainly paid vat. should a 5-year-old spending his pocket money get a vote, because of the vat on his lego? and of course, it runs the risk of people flipping it and saying \"no representation without taxation\"; because if you link taxation to representation, then there\\'s going to be someone that argues that anyone that is unemployed should lose the vote until they are contributing to society financially again.']",

i haven’t pre-ordered anything since the witcher 2! i don’t buy stupid cosmetics and i don’t buy ubisoft/ea/activison stuff but it’s soo easy to not pre-order! why not wait until the games been out an hour?!\\nanyway, i’m part of the problem here too because i stopped following it once it failed, but this seems to be eu only now? so is there anything we could do anyway?\\nbut yes, the article is shit, it mentions pirate software who to be clear, is a _person_…there was some controversy about him recently i’ve forgotten and if i recall, he’s on the side of the industry because his dad worked for blizzard? or he did…don’t remember\\nbut the tldr thing that should be mentioned is this really came about when _ubisoft_ removed the crew 2?…as well as the first from their servers, an online only title not necessarily multiplayer and stopped you from playing a game _you spent £60-100+_ from accessing, as a single player game. now, to be clear, it’s not a one off, ubisoft is one of the worst culprits but definitely not the only. if this fails it proves that you do not own your games i don’t want to get into this argument, yes, americans don’t but pretty sure eu once ruled in a case ages ago that we do and it sets precedent for them to remove any from your library. it’s one thing saying they don’t want to pay for servers but it’s another to cease and desist anyone who will. it’s also different when they block us playing single player games.\\nbut this of course effects all games, including retro ones which nintendo are horribly into suing your face off, including getting someone locked up for years gary bowser…yes, his real name and he owes them $14m for life!.\\nbasically, it can really hurt game preservation and screws over everyone. even if you’re not a gamer you should care because one, it’s the corps giving us a dystopian future but two, most importantly, the world is increasingly more digital and if they win, you’ll own nothing. it sets precedent they can remove your songs, films, whatever if you own it online somewhere on a server.']",

it was calculated by the dwp that for every £1 spent on the scheme, it contributes back somewhere between £1.50-£1.90 to treasury this is from memory, i can\\'t find the actual sums - that\\'s due to the disabled person being employed earn a salary, paying taxes, having money to spend into the economy, able to support themselves etc. in this case of a deaf person, it\\'s also employing other people as well - the interpreters get to earn as well etc. also there\\'s the knock-on effect that it can allow for better health, less demand for other welfare such as umemployment, housing etc. different disability would have different needs - it may be a one off sum or an ongoing cost. atw i think is a fantastic scheme that really does help to try and give the disabled a more equal footing to anyone else - a company cannot say \"this person cost us x more to employ because we have to pay for interpreters etc\". they just pay a salary for that person, just like anyone else. granted it\\'s not perfect but every bit helps. imho better than how it is done in usa as i understand it - a deaf person working for a large company is entiled to interpreters etc under the ada law, but the company is the one that foots the bill', 'government spending this year is estimated to be £1.2tn. there are 70m people in the uk. so that’s an average of £17k per person. a few things you’re missing. first, most households don’t have children. only 42% of households include one or more dependent children under 18. so, by focussing on a family with two parents and two children, you’ve skewed the necessary tax take from each household to be much higher than it actually is. the “average” household is actually 0.7 dependent children and 1.9 adults. which, if we allocate £17k to each person, is a government spending of £44k per household.\\nsecond, the total tax take is not solely personal taxes. income tax is only about 27% of total tax take, with national insurance another 11%. so if we just look at income tax and national insurance each average household has to contribute 38% of 44k, which is £16,800. if we assume the 1.9 adults each earn the same wage then each adult has to pay £8.6k in income tax and national insurance to cover their costs. which is an income of about £43k. the median wage in the uk is about £38k, which is close to this level. the gap is made up from borrowing.', 'and this all breaks down to the truth that people want to ignore.\\nbasing a country\\'s or government success on financial balance; viewing humans as either a burden or contributor to the economy, and conflating the economy with the welfare of the country. this is a fundamentally unsustainable way of running a country. there is no way around it unless humans have an infinitely increasing ability to be productive, which they obviously don\\'t.\\nmoney and thus the economy is a representation of the value a country\\'s people can produce. but the people who are benefiting most from it have pretty much detached the concept of money from the thing that creates its value. now they want to blame everyone else.\\npeople are chronically underpaid while the excess value of their labour is taken as profit by people of the city. thus the workers aren\\'t \"contributing\" as much in tax because their wages don\\'t reflect the actual produced value of their labour. not to even start on the lack of financial \"value\" of the underpaid care and health workers.', \"how do you guys think a state works? the taxes the state receives should be distributed back to the citizens. the 17k aren't pocket money for some fortunate guys somewhere, that's the share of infrastructure costs, hospitals, museums, schools, rearch im addition to monetary benefits. all things we profit from.\\nand yes, the average family doesn't pay as much as what they profit from. that's by design. not only are stronger shoulders supposed to carry more load, companies are not counted as people here. companies are paying tax so that people profit. but that kinda obfuscates the point that it's actually people working for those companies in the first place creating that profit.\\ndon't get scared if it looks like people take more than they contribute. that's how it's supposed to be. plus, a lot of people's work, be it volunteering, care work, raising children, maintaining their houses and flats, are not priced into the equation.\", 'it’s interesting too; the uk government does not want stay at home parents as it’s bad for the economy. they’d prefer two people working and making 50k each then one person making 100k. that’s just paye though; vat and other taxes contribute to the economy too and shouldn’t be discounted.\\ntechnically though the stay at home parents family likely contributes more to the economy than those earning 50k each. as taxes are higher and unable to get child benefit etc.\\ni mean there’s a number of reasons why they do it, but i do wish tax was assessed on household income. i also wish they’d reform council tax as the bandings make no sense; but since thatcher made a mess with poll tax no one wants to touch it.', \"the government burns it's money on day to day solutions to long term problems.\\nif more money goes on healthcare it almost always goes in staff costs, rather than on equipment that would boost productivity if more money is diverted to housing, it goes on pumping up the rental market through housing benefit or on pumping up house prices through help to buy. rather than building housing.\\nthe list goes on and on.\\noh and it likes to privatise things and then create giant bureaucracies that try to force free market operators to act against their own interests. consuming way more effort and money than just having the state do what the state wants.\\nbritain is the ultimate expression of a state-as-pfi.\", \"well, 20% of the population is given 12k cash pensions. and that's probably what you're thinking of. then there's the 18% that are children the vast majority of which go to school.\\nbut in reality that figure isn't cash given to those people. it's dividing all costs of roads, policing, fighter aircraft, diplomatic shit, hospitals, doctors, and debt payments etc.\\nand of course it's not all paid for through income taxes. income taxes is only 28% of the uk's revenue, with ni being 18%. there's vat - you pay 20% of everything you purchase in tax. then there's business taxes, fuel duty, capital gains etc:\", \"a large chunk is medical costs. they are heavily concentrated to a small number of people, not equally over the whole population.\\nbut yes ,you can think that way that when you are 20 you're £100k or so in the negative. but then you start paying in. and in the following years you pay way more than the government spends on you. then by the age 65 you're way over on the positive side and then start eating that again. and no, a median person does not contribute as much as they get on the average. and that is how it supposed to be in a progressive society who wants to reduce economic inequality.\", \"i expect this will get downvoted, but the reality is the uk is very reliant on higher rate taxpayers to subsidise the rest of the country. more so than most of europe.\\nthis also highlights why it's really important for us to focus on immigration policy that targets higher earners. low wage migrants are mathematically going to be a net burden on the taxpayer. we really should only be importing people who are going to either earn a lot here, or filling truly essential roles we can't fill ourselves.\"]",

reiterates what we already know - we used to do stuff and now we can’t. there are things we built a century ago which we can’t do now which means something, somewhere politically has gone very, very wrong. the points made are totally correct - housing is gone, universities are about to collapse which is not hyperbole at all, social care is emaciated, and no one knows what to do? we pay more than ever, for barely anything. people bark on about the collapse of the roman empire and try to equate it to modern times. it’s almost always a pointless pursuit because conditions of modernity and antiquity are so different. there is one moral of the story of the romans which we can however think about which is what happened when wealth is hoarded and the state can’t tax it. the villa system of the late roman empire was exactly that - the wealth of entire regions, all of the land, food, trade, and resources became concentrated in the hands powerful families. all of the inter-region trade became private exchanges and the wealth generated became untaxable. the total lack of funding led to the decay of the institutions, and to the decline of the roman armies. in the end, it just broke apart, unable to hold itself together.\\nthe spectre of inequality seems to be the horsemen of the apocalypse for states - where it looms and haunts, there follows decline shortly thereafter. most, if not all of our problems can be reduced to chronic inequality, the insistence on maintaining the classical class system, and a total refusal to become a fully modern state. there is in my view no political fix. what we have is what we have and something new will replace it one day. a whole new social contract with much more equal terms.\\nradicals will step forward and say the issue is moral; that we are morally lost and a return to religion will save us. others will condemn the market and say we must abandon economics entirely. the issue is not morality, nor the greed of capitalism. it is an inability to form a coherent vision for who we want to be, and what that entails. trying to fix this by becoming the priest, or running to the comfort of tradition won’t tell us who we are. we need to move forward and find emancipation. anything that came before is not a solution but an attempt to reject the problem and run away.', \"everybody in these comments has someone to blame but can't see

culture, not immigrants, not the disabled, just plain old rich people.\\ncorporate welfare, cronyism, tax avoidance, poverty wages etc are all to blame for your problems, not old gay brown people on benefits.\\nwhen money is hoarded instead of being fed back into the economy, it's the average worker that suffers - it's very basic economics.\\nthe rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and it's only going to get worse because you're all too distracted by identity politics to do anything about it.\\nwe must come together to expropriate the rich and have a workers revolution

never be like them, don't be a class traitor. remove the boot from your neck, before it is too late. please, you have a choice.\\nwhen society is run on growth, for profit, it is only logical that society will collapse, as all growth is finite - the earth has been raped and pillaged enough and the capitalist's exploitation and oppression agenda is coming to end. the good thing about the elites

competency in politics understands this already. the issue isn\\'t that politicians and economists are stupid, it\\'s that they know doing what you\\'re suggesting would be extremely unpopular. regardless of the truth of it \"pensioners\" are seen as a vulnerable class by the media and public, and workers earning a mediocre £30,000 a year are seen as pretty well off compared to the disabled, students, pensioners, low-income workers, single mums, asylum seekers, etc.\\nmost people who vote in the uk are net-beneficiaries of increased gov spending and this will only increase as more people enter retirement and we open voting franchise to children. the political incentives are just not there to do what you\\'re saying and the incentives to change course get worse with every passing year.\\nthe same is true of tax reform... economists across the spectrum agree tax reform is far more important than fiddling with the rates of existing taxes. the issue is that tax reform is politically unpopular so we\\'re left with a broken tax system, which is why instead of fixing the problem politicians prefer to make it worse by doing stupid stuff like increasing stamp duty or increasing employers ni.\\nwe need to fix the incentives if we want to fix things, but it\\'s really hard to see how we fix the incentives given we\\'ve allowed the incentives to become so bad and keep making them worse.', \"i always laugh when i see articles like this in 2025. the writing was on the wall around a decade ago, if not earlier. this article is just stating the obvious for anyone

position of importance despite our empire collapsing. we're no different from any other former empire. not only that but there is this idea that we were once a powerful wealthy nation that ruled the world. in a way we did, if you count rich elites as the nation. the average brit has always suffered a miserable life. the industrial revolution was an awful time for an average person. the boomers will be the luckiest people to ever live in human history. but their fortunes were just a blip in history. climate change will ensure that human living is never as good ever again. the planet has been sacrificed to uphold boomer's first world materialist lifestyles. at no other point in history was the average human so well fed and financially secure. there's a reason billionaires are building bunkers. they know what's coming, and they aren't gonna help you.\", \"imagine yourself as a pensioner. you have no security beyond what your pension will provide. no ability to ride out economic shocks beyond hope of government assistance. not every pensioner is hoarding a heap of wealth. indeed many are trapped in houses larger than they need because moving is either overwhelming or can't be considered because their pension doesn't leave room for savings towards moving costs.\\nthose pensioners who do have wealth, are using it to help younger generations already by gifting money to children and grandchildren. pensioners are available to spend money in retail and hospitality during the week when everyone else is working, so therefore play a huge role in keeping those sectors, and others, alive.\\nand it is morally right that we look after the elderly, just as it is morally right that we look after our children. consider how much free childcare is being undertaken by older people in our country right now, because of the problems of childcare provision.\\ni write this as a 35 year old working man with older parents who have comfortable means and undertake a full day of unpaid childcare, and help us with our mortgage every month.\", 'uk citizenry needs to generate even more income in order to boost tax income and savings so that future generations won’t have to rely on triple lock pensions to provide for them in the old age, but their own wealth. the big question is how to go about it. the grand roman empire that everyone seems to bring up when it’s appropriate and when it’s not, has built its massive wealth on conquest, pillage and to some degree on innovation and progress. well, they were pretty much the only ones building roads, aqueducts and such, weren’t they? so, since you can’t really go about raping aboriginals any more until money falls out of them then the only choice is innovation. uk needs massive investment in productive assets, preferably those with high export potential. look at south korea for instance. they got their shit together and started making cars, decent ones i might add. they took a fishing village and built a massive factory there that now supplies sk proper and rolls out cars straight onto the ships for export. and sk is not even a proper country, it’s actually half a country. remember the korean war and

everything is getting more expensive and people don’t really want to pay for it when they are struggling. maybe we need to re-cut our cloth so it is focused on the right endeavours. however when a party has tried to cut spending to balance the books they had an internal revolt and had to backtrack. so we are likely stuck on a path of terminal decline for the time being. make the most of what

probably not, so it makes sense to put them in one location. in which case why not just build a traditional reactor?\\nsimilar story for guarding it, how many armed guards would you need if you had hundreds of locations with nuclear material? how many less would that be if it were only a dozen of locations?\\nmaybe they are genuinely cheaper if put in one location, i don’t really know', \"as i say, the end result is brilliant. we should be investing far more in nuclear. if we'd put the hs2 money into nuclear power and changed the planning regulations so that we could build power stations as cheaply as even other western countries, then we could have 80% of our baseload covered by nuclear power owned by the state and operated on a cost plus basis. we'd have some of the cheapest power in the world.\\nthat shouldn't detract from the appalling impact our regulatory framework is having on our economy and country as a whole, which was what the rest of my post was about.\", 'pretty much yeah. the planning process for hinckley took years, cost a fortune and by many reports is ridiculously over designed and over engineered because of how many special interest groups launched legal challenges to make sure the nuclear plant wouldn’t spoil the view or suck rare fish in to the turbines accidentally. sizewell is the same. the planning and regulation process needs to be massively stripped back for these projects. we need many more of these things just to replace the plants due to be decommissioned, let alone for the backbone of a green energy grid.', 'my understanding is it’s less about the skills/infastructure and more that the costs are down to regulations, local challenges and delays.\\nthis is my personal issue with big nuclear, clearly we were stupid not to build years back but today there’s no suggestion if we double down now it’ll get massively cheaper to build due to the regulations and local challenges like having enough freshwater etc - we don’t have the space, deregulation etc other countries have that are throwing up nuclear stations at the moment', \"we struggle to build tiny little refuge zones attached to already existing motorways. new power stations were never going to be cheap in this country. of course, we shouldn't accept that this will always be the case, and tbh if i was in government my top priority would be sorting out why everything we try and build takes so long and costs so much, but we aren't in a place to simply wish into existence the infrastructure, plannimg schemes or capabilities of other countries.\", \"hinkley point c is 2 reactors of 1,600 mw each for a total of 3,200 mw. which nuclear is baseload, anytime power which also is carbon free.\\nsizewell c is also 2 reactors of 1,600 mw each for a total of 3,200 mw. hinkley point c will generate 7% of britain's current electrical production. and sizewell c another 7%. also a great success story is sizewell b which was completed in 1995 and is 1 reactor of 1,191 mw. it generates about 2.5% of britain's electricity.\", \"it's a big number, but worth it for sure. how many billions are spent yearly on other things which aren't going to improve the country massively for future generations.\\nsay we spend about £6 billion per year on asylum seekers. so a new nuclear power plant costs the same as about 6 years of housing asylum seekers at the current rate?

if we need a new phone, we don’t need to buy the latest iphone. a phone a couple generations before still does almost the same thing, but at a fraction of the price. if your mate were struggling for cash and bought a brand new phone you’d think they were an idiot. even if he told you he was upgrading from a nokia brick, which we can all agree is too old and even a poor man can’t make do with, you’d ask him why it had to be the newest/an iphone specifically when any smartphone made in the last couple years would be a considerable improvement and give everything he’ll need for a long time.', '>as politicians set about trying to get approval to make hs2 run straight and fast, they came across another obstacle.\\n>much of the route cut through rural constituencies, represented mostly by conservative mps, who made it clear to then-prime minister david cameron that their approval for the project would require serious negotiation and compromise.\\n>ministers picked something unusual to make it happen: a hybrid bill, only the third of its kind enacted since 1992.\\n>these allow mps to vote on whether a piece of infrastructure should go ahead, but those directly affected are given the right to petition against it and ask for details to be changed.\\n>\"i was told that the bill basically gave the planning approval,\" says patrick mcloughlin, who was the transport secretary between 2012 and 2016.\\n>\"of course, it subsequently turns out that that was not the case.\"\\n>in reality, the hybrid bill only offered \"deemed planning permission\" -

hs1 basically just doubled the price to get a maybe 20 minute faster journey time euston to birmingham. you have to build the railway to a far higher spec to withstand the speed of the trains and the route had to be as straight as possible. a straight line is a problem when it comes to cost, because if you run into a landowner who doesn’t want to sell, a nimby village, or a bat problem or whatever, you basically have no other option but to throw money at the issue until all impacted parties are appeased. a regular high speed rail could have had more literal “wiggle room” to divert a few miles around such issues. that’s why lord hendy said in hindsight hs2 is “too fast.” faster than we needed to solve what was primarily a capacity issue, not enough trains per hour able to run between london and birmingham on the track we have, and we’ve run into expensive new issues as a result. not good value for money, like buying a ferrari when you only need a cheap runner to pop to tesco in. what he went on to explain was there’s no need for the uk to run trains at high speed, because we’re a small island and our cities are only a few hours apart by train already. super high speed really makes a difference in bigger countries, but over a hundred mile stretch there’s not actually that much time the train has to run at top speed.', \"blame attlee, not thatcher. all of this harks back to the town and planning act of 1947 in which development rights were nationalised and became state-controlled. this was the pivotal moment in which infrastructure got far, far harder to build. the quangos and regulatory bodies have grown and grown since - but they've all built off attlee's foundations. the last time we built major infrastructure quickly and cheaply was... under thatcher... and she specifically did this by getting round the attlee-ian hellscape of regulations and bureaucratic-control through bypassing local councils etc, turning london docklands into a post-industrial wasteland to a global financial hub in an incredibly short period of time.\", \">maybe 20 minute faster journey time euston to birmingham\\nthis is exactly the kind of short-termist thinking that limits this kind of project. 20 minutes faster from euston to birmingham isn't a deal-breaker, but the original plan for hs2 went as far as leeds, and there was scope to extend lines to scotland in the future. for those kinds of distances, that time saving does make a difference.\\n>not good value for money, like buying a ferrari when you only need a cheap runner to pop to tesco in\\ni'd liken it more to buying a cast-iron pan that'll last you the rest of your life rather than buying something cheap and non-stick that'll be useless in 5 years.\", \"i'm not sure i would fold data assessment and the costing of plan bs and cs into the section of consultation that necessarily needs scrapping. two weeks of data analysis work which could be in-house rather than an external firm is much cheaper than years of consulting and negotiating with special interest groups, mps, residents, and so on.\\nfundamentally the expensive thing about consultation is that it is endless, and we're not negotiating with actors working in good faith. data analysis is just fundamentally different. i think i largely agree with you, i just wouldn't single out this example as the worst of the rot.\", '\"this is an infrastructure project that\\'ll last a century or more - why would you not want to make it the best possible line?\"\\ni somewhat agree with this viewpoint as a starting position, but that does treat hs2 in isolation. you also have to consider that you could have the best possible line for hs2, but if you have a slightly slower one that\\'s still very fast you could also build hs3 too for likely a similar overall budget and have a super fast transpennine link as well as the much faster north-south links and the extra capacity for the southern chunk of the wcml.', 'really enjoyed this bit:\\n”andrew meaney is head of transport at the consultancy oxera and advised the oakervee review of hs2 that reported to government in 2020. andrew suggests no analysis was done to set out comparisons of what the savings would be if trains ran at the slower speeds of eurostar services in the south of england. “i think those sorts of things should have been assessed in quite a lot of detail and a public conversation had about those trade-offs.\"\\na consultant saying the problem wasn’t that there wasn’t enough consultation. brilliant.', \"we're mostly adopting the french stuff, which everything they build at the moment is for 350kmh. that would mean we could buy the same trains as them, saving money, have trains that operate between the uk and france easily although we jibbed that tiny section of track for cost saving. the alternative would be to build for 300kmh and still buy all the french stuff and saving zero, or develop our own stuff and spend a load of cash.\\nbasically its probably not even worth asking that question.\", 'no, i see a point about that. there was so much opposition to the project on the basis it was sold to the public as slashing 20 minutes off travel time, and nothing about line capacity. i think saying \"making the line high speed would only change costs by x% -- most of the cost isn\\'t about speed, but a new line for capacity, freeing up existing lines for more regular, more spacious, less cramped regional services\" would have been much more important for public backing']",

not necessary to have money to live off when you’re older in all cases. someone who’ll be executed tomorrow doesn’t need it. if you put money in a savings account where penalties for early withdrawal exist – or early withdrawal is impossible – you implicitly believe that you will be around to withdraw it, and the society which allows this to happen will keep on existing.\\nand – as your colleagues accurately say – there is an opportunity cost to doing this, and the opportunity cost gets higher the less disposable income you have. saving money for thirty years’ time when you don’t have a lot of money now necessitates a calculation on the likelihood of locking away the money paying off.\\xa0the public – in my view correctly – judge the trade-off as unlikely to be worth it.\\nmy impression of finance people is that they consistently fail to deal with this, and will not reckon with what it means that their arguments are predicated on a level of optimism the general public don’t hold. and a lot of the time they dismiss this as stupid— even though a company which locked its money away for 30 years and didn’t spend any now would be held to be stupid as well, for exactly the reasons i’m saying! the public act as they do because they do not believe their pensions will ever be realised. in that light, their behaviour is completely rational. it is you, and your field, who needs to confront this. you could start by consulting with your sensible-sounding colleagues', '>just one in two workers is it me, or is this a slightly odd way of writing \"half\"?\\n>liz kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said the three-member taskforce, led by trade unionist and labour peer baroness jeannie drake, would “tackle the barriers that stop too many saving in the first place”.\\npresumably, the biggest barrier is people not having enough spare money that they can afford to save in the first place. if you want people to save more, then the best thing to do is either increase wages or lower living costs.\\n>under the current system, at least 8pc of salaries are paid into pension pots with employees required to save a minimum 5pc and companies paying 3pc.\\n>...\\n>according to a pension industry source, the “common consensus” is a savings rate of 12pc, matching the current level in australia.\\nor we could just force people and their employers to increase the amount we save, and let them worry about how they actually afford it.', \"most schemes operate on a 5 and 3 ees/ers or 4 and 4 basis so to get to 12 percent say 6 and 6 the leap is not that big, particularly with a transition period rather than a big bang. for a worker in the median salary of approx £37500, getting to 6% from 5% contributions is going to cost £18 a month once you adjust for tax and ni savings. only extreme edge cases are going to be pushed over the edge by that. employers will of course have a great big bellyache over having to find that extra 3 points just like they do with everything else but tbh fuck them for doing the bare minimum. employers with a decent pension scheme will already be over that 12% minimum as is so won't feel the effects.\", 'people are fundamentally awful on this whole topic tax, tax relief, pensions, isas, savings, stocks and shares\\ni have had similar chats with people at work who confidentially waffle incorrect information about all of them. i do wonder if it might shift, i think there are a lot of people in the boome x demographic who are very unsavvy with their money and have kind of gotten away with it just due to having good economic luck during key working years for them.\\nif millennials and gen z etc are as financially illiterate, the economy will not be able to prop them up coincidentally and they will massively suffer in retirement. however i think they might actually be aware of this.', \"surprisingly few people understand the massive tax advantages of saving into a pension, especially once you break the 50k tax band. you basically get 20%-45% free money whenever you tip up your pension, plus your employer may add additional money. i had to explain to a colleague who was obsessed with picking stocks and crypto how you would almost never beat the tax efficiency of investing in a pension once tax is factored in. it makes sense to opt people in to saving more, and explaining the benefits. otherwise they'll end up the shortfall by relying on public welfare later in life. which probably wont exist by that point.\", \"i'm not against this in principle. it seems they just want the rate to go up to 12% from 8%. presumably increasing the employer contribution to 4-5% and employee to 7-6% by default, which would be fairly negligible unless you're already living at the absolute edge of your means. personally i already contribute more than that so for me it would just mean the employer contribution goes up. i wouldn't be complaining about that.\\ni'm sure people will criticise this now, but in 30 years time when the state pension system has collapsed they'll be glad for those couple of extra percentage points.\", \"i just don't really believe that a couple of percentage points of pre-tax income will massively affect most people in the short term but would benefit them considerably in the long term. at the median salary that's like 60 quid a month - which is what like \\\\~40 quid post-tax? the price of a takeaway basically.\\nedit: actually i'm not sure what the qualifying earnings are for 35k\\nthere will always be reasons not to prepare for retirement - costs now always seem more important. but the reality of the situation is that it is not guaranteed that the state will pick up the tab at this point.\", \"that's a recipe for how to discourage saving for retirement unless it's pitched very very high and then it doesn't save any money.\\nthe state pension is not welfare. you have to pay national insurance for 35 years to be eligible and i know people who've had to do that voluntarily due to working abroad in order to still be able to retire.\\nto cap it all what you're suggesting is that the people who have paid the most towards the system in their lives should be the ones not to get it. means testing should be completely abolished for this reason alone.\", \"you're probably right but don't underestimate the young and stupid population who would rather piss away their money right now. i have multiple friends who went directly into big4 type employment at 21-22 years old who put the bare legal minimum in, or even opted out. they were well into the higher tax bracket at the time too, so it would've been a huge tax relief.\\nfinancial literacy and the lack thereof is one of the largest drags on this country's wealth imo. we have a nation of people who have absolutely no idea how to invest sensibly.\", 'problem is you join the workforce and you have a choice: rent and food now or pension later, and at 19/20, 70 seems like a long way away.\\n‘i’ll save later once i’ve brought a house’ is a common theme amongst my graduates, the only issue is that they are typically 30-35 before they can even consider buying which then only leaves 35 years to save, but now they have a mortgage and kids to fund so they put it off again… ultimately the housing crisis and the cost of living are the two barriers to saving for retirement.']",

why would people not want to sacrifice their time and lifestyle for kids now, but will want to in 100 years?\\nit could easily go either way, maybe the problem will get worse or maybe it'll get better. frankly this situation is unprecedented, predictions have been wildly wrong before. not even the perennial doomsayers expected fertility to drop this far, this fast.\\nnot saying it can't rebound, but i haven't seen any strong evidence either way. i have seen lots of unsubstantiated assertions.\", 'the understanding the why is important.\\ni watched a documentary on the fertility crisis globally which for the life of me i cant remember the name of.\\nbut it put forward the idea that family size has broadly remain almost perfectly in ratio, what has increased is the number with zero.\\nwhen polled at around 20, women still want the same number of children broadly as 40 years ago. with only 10% suggesting they dont want children, again in line with 40 years ago.\\nthe problem reveals itself in the average age of having a child being 30. and the biological reality of the precipitous declined in fertility after as you move through your 30s. with 50% of women who hit 30 childless, hitting 40 childless. we need to seriously reconsider how we structure \"younger\" life.\\nyou can get a degree at 45, you can work until your 70, soon you won\\'t have a choice you\\'ll have too. but if you\\'ve not had a child by 35 and you want one, youre odds are getting pretty slim.\\nwe need to change the incentive structure so women men too its not like all these things dont apply to men just to a lesser extent feel like they can have kids at 25. if you take a 10 year career break at that point, you\\'ve still got 35 years to build a career which is all most of the boomers had retiring at 55-60. but if you spend 20-32 laying down the foundations of your career, you\\'ve drastically cut youre chances to build a family. particularly if your career focus means you get to 32 and still need go find a viable partner. we need to start having children younger and figure out how to incentivise it at a state level.', \">i think more people would have kids if they could move out and build decent careers in their early 20s instead of by their 40s if they are lucky.\\nyup. i really want to be a mother but i'm 27 and i'm back to living at home for financial reasons. it'll probably be a good few years before i can save up to move out, and then on a personal level i just really, really want some time to live by myself and be independent.\\nby that time i'll be in my mid 30s. the thought of not taking advantage of my one precious life to raise a baby kills me. but so does the thought of living in poverty for my entire life.\\npretty much every issue has money at it's core..\", 'the thing is though, if having less children is just a natural consequence of societal advancement we are at some point going to have to face up to that reality. like what’s the solution?
